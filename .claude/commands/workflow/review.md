Conduct a code review of $1.

Your aim is to convince a skeptical human that you have found all relevant issues and no false positive problems. To this end, create a report including snippets or line references to the problematic code. Justify why you think this is, or could be, a problem, quoting from authoratitive sources including books and online references known to you.

When reviewing, point out:
 - possible maintenance problems
 - unnecessarily complex solutions
 - where more code has been added than strictly necessary
 - hard to understand for humans
 - unnecessary comments
 - architechtural bad practices
 - security issues or potential problems
 - anything which deviates from existing project conventions.

Suggest solutions to any issues you find. Where multiple good solutions or options exist, explain all options.
